      "description": "The retinal fundus image shows significant pathological changes indicative of diabetic retinopathy. There are numerous hemorrhages visible as red spots scattered across the retina. Exudates are present, appearing as fluffy white areas, suggesting leakage from blood vessels. The retinal vessels appear distorted and irregular, with evidence of venous beading. Neovascularization is evident, with new, fragile blood vessels growing on the optic disc and elsewhere in the retina. These findings are consistent with a high-grade diabetic retinopathy, likely proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).",
