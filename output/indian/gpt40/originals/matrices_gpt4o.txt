The model is very conservative ‚Äî it almost always says ‚ÄúNo Referral.‚Äù

When it does say ‚ÄúReferral,‚Äù it‚Äôs accurate, but it very rarely says it.

This makes recall for referrals dangerously low, which is bad in a screening setting ‚Äî we want to catch all possible referral cases, even at the cost of a few false positives.

No Referral (Negative Class):
Recall = 1.00 ‚Üí GPT correctly identifies all 71 true negatives.

Precision = 0.76 ‚Üí Of all predictions labeled as "No Referral", 76% were correct.

‚ö†Ô∏è This means it's being overcautious: even if a case should be referred, it's still calling it "No Referral" unless it's very confident.

üîπ Referral (Positive Class):
Precision = 1.00 ‚Üí Every case that GPT labels as ‚ÄúReferral‚Äù truly is referable.

Recall = 0.31 ‚Üí But it only catches 31% of the actual referable cases (10 out of 32).

‚ö†Ô∏è It's missing 69% of referable DR cases ‚Äî potentially vision-threatening oversight.
Compared to your earlier GPT results without the CNN prompt, where referral recall was just 6%, the CNN prompt boosted recall to 31%, suggesting:

GPT-4o is somewhat responsive to the label injection ‚Äî it‚Äôs more willing to call something referable when you hint that it might be.

However:

The recall is still too low to be clinically safe.

The model is highly precise for referrals ‚Äî but at the cost of missing most of them.

This behavior is consistent with anchoring bias without sufficient visual understanding.

Referral Recall:
This measures how many of the actual patients who needed referral were correctly identified by your model.

What‚Äôs Good:
Referral precision = 1.00: Every time GPT says "refer", it's correct ‚Äî no false alarms.

Referral recall = 0.41 (‚Üë from 0.31 at 80% CNN): It now catches 13/32 referable cases.

No referral recall = 1.00: It correctly catches all true negatives (doesn‚Äôt refer patients who don‚Äôt need it).

Overall accuracy = 82% ‚Äî a modest improvement over 79% with 80% CNN.

‚ö†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Still a Problem:
Misses 19 of 32 referable cases (59%) ‚Äî so it's still not safe as a primary screening tool.

It's anchored heavily toward saying ‚ÄúNo Referral‚Äù, even with stronger CNN hints.
