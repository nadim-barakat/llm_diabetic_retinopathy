 *******
 Great — this comparison is very informative. Let's walk through what these two sets of metrics are telling you about your **continuous score vs. discrete grade** predictions.

## 🔍 Confusion Matrix Breakdown

### **Using Continuous Score (Threshold = 20)**

```
True labels vs. predictions:
               Predicted
               0     1
            -------------
Actual  0 |   51    20     → TN, FP
        1 |   14    18     → FN, TP
```

* **True Positives (TP)** = 18 → Correctly referred
* **False Negatives (FN)** = 14 → Missed referrals
* **False Positives (FP)** = 20 → Over-referred
* **True Negatives (TN)** = 51 → Correctly said no referral

### **Using Discrete Grade (threshold ≥ 3)**

```
True labels vs. predictions:
               Predicted
               0     1
            -------------
Actual  0 |   71     0     → TN, FP
        1 |   30     2     → FN, TP
```

* **TP** = 2 → Very few correctly referred
* **FN** = 30 → Missed most referrals
* **FP** = 0 → Never over-refers
* **TN** = 71 → Very conservative

## ✅ Metric Interpretation

| Metric       | Continuous Score (T=20) | Discrete Grade (≥3) | Interpretation                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F1**       | 0.51                    | 0.12                | Continuous score has far better balance of precision and recall                                |
| **Accuracy** | 0.67                    | 0.71                | Discrete is slightly more "accurate" overall but misleading (it predicts mostly "no referral") |
| **TP**       | 18                      | 2                   | Continuous catches many more real referrals                                                    |
| **FP**       | 20                      | 0                   | Discrete never over-refers, but at a huge cost (30 missed referrals)                           |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* **The discrete model is too conservative**: it avoids all false positives but misses **almost all true positives** (recall = 2 / 32 = 6.25%).
* **The continuous model (threshold 20)** makes some false referrals but **catches 18/32** referrals → much better sensitivity.
* **F1 score is much higher** with the continuous score — meaning it’s **better balanced** for real-world use (especially in medicine, where false negatives can be dangerous).

---

### 🎯 Conclusion

* The **discrete grade is under-referring** — too strict.
* The **continuous score** (when thresholded at 20) gives a **better tradeoff** between catching real referrals and avoiding false alarms.
* Even though **accuracy is slightly lower**, the model is **clinically more useful** because it’s not missing almost every patient who needs help.

Let me know if you want help picking the best threshold to balance **false positives vs false negatives**, or if you want to visualize this.
