Yes — that’s **exactly** the correct interpretation.

Let’s walk through the evidence and logic clearly:

---

### ✅ **Before giving external input (no info about another model):**

* **Recall for No Referral**: 59%
* **Confusion Matrix**:

  ```
  [[41 28]   ← 69 truly No Referral cases → 41 correctly predicted, 28 incorrectly referred
   [ 2 30]]  ← 32 truly Referral cases → 30 correctly predicted
  ```

→ The model correctly avoided referrals **most of the time** for true no-referral cases.

---

### ❗ After giving the LLM a model with "80% accuracy" that always gave the *correct* answer:

* **Recall for No Referral**: **26%**
* **Confusion Matrix**:

  ```
  [[12 34]   ← 46 truly No Referral → only 12 correctly predicted as no referral
   [ 0 30]]  ← 30 truly Referral → 30 correctly predicted
  ```

→ The model now **misses most of the no-referral cases** (only catches 12/46), while still catching all referral cases.

---

### 🧠 So what changed?

Even though you gave the LLM correct answers from an external model, you **told it the external model has 80% accuracy**, which implies it can be wrong.

What the LLM likely did:

* Trusted the external model *only when* it predicted **Referral**.
* But became **more cautious** when the external model predicted **No Referral**, knowing it might miss disease.
* So it started **over-referring**, just in case.

---

### 🔍 Conclusion:

> **Yes — the LLM became more conservative/cautious after receiving external model input, even though that model was always right.**

That’s a powerful insight: the LLM is sensitive to **stated confidence**, not just correctness. This shows promise for studying how LLMs weigh second opinions and probabilistic advice.

Let me know if you want help designing variations of this experiment (e.g., flipping model accuracy, giving incorrect answers, etc.).
