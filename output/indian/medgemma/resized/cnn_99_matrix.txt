 *************
 Hereâ€™s a full comparison of all **four scenarios**:
**Zero-shot**, **CNN 80%**, **CNN 95%**, and **CNN 99% confidence**.

## ðŸ”¢ Multiclass Grading (0â€“4)

| Metric             | Zero-Shot | CNN @ 80% | CNN @ 95% | CNN @ 99% |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Accuracy**       | 29.1%     | **47.6%** | 44.7%     | 42.7%     |
| **Macro F1**       | 27.5%     | **42.9%** | 38.7%     | 36.5%     |
| **Weighted F1**    | 31.9%     | **49.2%** | 46.6%     | 44.8%     |
| **Class 0 Recall** | 17.6%     | 44.1%     | 44.1%     | **44.1%** |
| **Class 1 Recall** | 0.0%      | **20.0%** | 0.0%      | 0.0%      |
| **Class 3 F1**     | 43.5%     | **52.2%** | 50.0%     | 46.8%     |

### Key Points:

* **Multiclass performance declines as CNN confidence increases beyond 80%**.
* **Class 1 recall drops to zero again** for 95% and 99%, likely due to the LLM deferring too heavily to CNN.
* **80% CNN** still shows the most balanced behavior.

## âœ… Binary Referral

| Metric                 | Zero-Shot | CNN @ 80% | CNN @ 95% | CNN @ 99% |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Accuracy**           | 78%       | 81%       | **82%**   | 79%       |
| **Referral Recall**    | 75%       | **88%**   | **88%**   | **88%**   |
| **Referral Precision** | 62%       | **64%**   | 65%       | 61%       |
| **Referral F1**        | 68%       | 74%       | **75%**   | 72%       |
| **No Referral Recall** | 79%       | 77%       | **79%**   | 75%       |

### Key Points:

* Binary referral recall stays **high (88%)** across all CNN-informed prompts.
* **Precision and F1 decline slightly** at 99% confidence, likely due to overcalling referrals based on CNN's authority.
* **Overall best binary performance remains with CNN @ 95%**.

## ðŸ§  Interpretation Summary

| Behavior / Goal                            | Best Setting  | Rationale                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiclass grading accuracy**            | **CNN @ 80%** | Model weighs CNN input but still uses own judgment    |
| **Binary referral accuracy**               | **CNN @ 95%** | Strongest F1 and precision for referral               |
| **Balanced minority class (e.g. Class 1)** | CNN @ 80%     | Only one that retains some recall for rare class      |
| **General over-reliance**                  | **CNN @ 99%** | Highest overconfidence â†’ flattens subtle distinctions |

---

## ðŸ§© Conclusion

Adding CNN input clearly helps â€” but there's a **sweet spot**:

* **80% CNN confidence gives best multiclass performance**
* **95% CNN confidence gives best binary referral performance**
* **99% CNN confidence starts to over-influence the LLM**, leading to reduced diversity and flexibility, especially for rare or ambiguous classes.
